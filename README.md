# Slouch Patrol

We were sitting in the Hall building 8th floor at Concordia, we were brainstorming for a project idea for our mini-capstone engineering course.

While looking around, we realised everyone had a very bad posture sitting down. This is when we decided that the project that would have the biggest impact is a posture detection wearable, this is were Slouch Patrol was born!
